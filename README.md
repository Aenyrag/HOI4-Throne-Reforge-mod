## 🏰 The World of 1935: An Alternate Crucible
**What if Napoleon III had won the Franco-Prussian War?**  
Throne Reforge envisions a world where the Bonapartist dynasty reclaimed European hegemony. By 1935:

- ⚜️ The French Empire reigns supreme after its phoenix-like rebirth
- ⚔️ Germany remains shattered but simmers with unification movements
- ⚰️ Austria-Hungary has collapsed under nationalist tides
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Revanchist Britain plots against Continental dominance
- 🐻 Expansionist Russia marches westward with imperial hunger

> *"Fate favored the Bonapartes once - but can the Empire survive this new crucible of history? Will destiny smile upon our Emperor once more?"*
